Description:

The code generator is for generating boiler plate code for a Pentaho Kettle Step. This is especially handy if you are writing several plugins and just want to concentrate on the business logic 
and not the boilerplate code that is required to make a Kettle plugin work. Below are a few screenshots:

If you are on a Mac, make sure to run it with the -XstartOnFirstThread flag to avoid "Invalid thread access" error.

Make sure to re-compile the code with SWT for your architecture.
